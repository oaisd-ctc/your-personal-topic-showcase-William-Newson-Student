                Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and the main protagonist of the One Piece
                series. At age seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and
                rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Gum-Gum Fruit , which gives him rubbery attributes.
                His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril causing Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing
                him. After this, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks, resolving instead to start a crew of his own and
                become King of the Pirates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ten years later and still wearing Shanks' treasured straw hat, Luffy forms and commands his own pirate
                crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line, quickly gaining infamy as "Straw
                Hat" Luffy. Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save his blood brother Ace from
                execution, he spends two years on a secluded island training before heading to the New World. Due to his
                infamy, he is one of the pirates who are known as "The Worst Generation." After the defeat of Kaido and
                Big Mom, he is subsequently named one of the newest members of the Four Emperors.

                Roronoa Zoro is a swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a
                third in his mouth. To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood friend and rival, he aims to
                defeat "Hawk-Eye" Mihawk and become the world's greatest swordsman. Traveling the seas in search of
                Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo, the spoiled son of a navy officer. To prevent the harm
                of innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be incarcerated temporarily, while Helmeppo plots to have
                him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that
                point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his
                dream. However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities
                change and he convinces Mihawk to take him on as a student.

                Adopted and raised by navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Belle-MÃ¨re, Nami witnessed her mother being
                murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the
                population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child, but already an accomplished cartographer who
                dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to buy freedom for her village
                eventually. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from
                other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket, and navigator with an exceptional ability

                to forecast weather. After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat
                Pirates, Nami joins them in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami

                During his early childhood, Usopp was abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who left to join the Red-Haired
                Pirates. As his mother, Bachina, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that
                his father will return and take them out to sea. He regularly goes to the mansion at the top of the hill
                where he lives, to visit Kaya. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving.
                Despite his cowardly disposition, he strives to become a great pirate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a
                gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor. In combat, he relies primarily on slingshots to fire various
                kinds of ammunition with great precision in coordination with a set of lies and other weapons giving him
                a unique fighting style. To help the Straw Hats rescue Nico Robin, he achieves notoriety under his
                alter-ego "Sogeking, the King of Snipers", a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape. Eventually,
                after helping the Straw Hats liberate Dressrosa from Donquixote Doflamingo's rule, he becomes infamous
                as "God" Usopp

                becomes a gift that Kaya gives to the Straw Hats as a reward for taking out Captain Kuro and his Black
                Cat Pirates. Over time, the crew come to love the ship as a home and as a friend, so much so that it
                literally takes on a life of its own and becomes just as much a part of the crew as any of them.

                Galley-La foremen. Built from Adam Wood, it is a magnificent ship of the finest craftsmanship, at least
                double the size of the Going Merry. Its features include practically all of Straw Hats' various requests
                before arriving in Water 7.

                by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue, a
                legendary area containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves
                Sanji's life by giving him all of their food. while Zeff eats his own leg. After their eventual rescue,
                Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie. Zeff in
                turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style. Mirroring Zeff, Sanji
                will never refuse a starving person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands
                he needs for cooking. He has a weakness for women and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it
                means his death.

                on surfaces near her. Behind her teachers' backs, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how
                to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyphs which are scattered around the world. She comes to
                share their goal of finding the elusive Real Poneglyph, which is said to tell the world's lost history
                referred to as the 100-Year Void. However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends

                promises to return after sailing around the world. After losing his captain "Calico" Yorki, Brook took
                over the crew as the new captain. Some time later, he is annihilated, but the power of the Revive-Revive
                Fruit allows him to resurrect as a skeleton. Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his
