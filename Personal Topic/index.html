                Setting
            </h2>
            <p>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves, giants, merfolk/fish-men, long-limbed tribes, and Minks.</p>
            <p>The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of nearly every country. The Navy protects the seas from pirates and other criminals. </p>
            <p>The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule.</p>
            <p> The One Piece world also has supernatural characteristics like Devil Fruits, which are magical fruits that grant whoever eats them super-powers.</p>
